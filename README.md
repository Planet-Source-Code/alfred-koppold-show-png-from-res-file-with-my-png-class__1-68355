## Show PNG from RES\-file with my PNG\-Class


</div>

### Description

I get a email with a question to my PNG-class:

I am a member of Planet Source Code and whilst looking for code so I can use .png files in my vb6 apps, I came across your superb png class. I would like to load a picture directly from a .res file though and can&#8217;t figure out how to do it! I could rip the picture to a temporary file and use that filepath for the filename, but I don&#8217;t want to have the picture available outside of the program.

So i make my class ready to open a included RES-file.

All the mails i send to Richard Couldridge (he send me the mail) come back to me. So i sent the source to PSC. This show the use of the class with a simple sample.

I hope i can help more peoples with this peace of code.
